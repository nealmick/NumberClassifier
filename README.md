# NumberClassifier

The model is trained on over 60,000 examples from the MNIST dataset and is able to accurately classify handwritten numbers. I implemented this project using the PyTorch framework and optimized the model's performance through techniques such as data augmentation and regularization. This project showcases my ability to use cutting-edge machine learning techniques and tools, as well as my understanding of neural network architecture and training.
